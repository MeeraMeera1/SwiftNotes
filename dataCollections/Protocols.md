# Lesson 1 : Protocols 

Protocol
: a set of rules that define how things are done (like a contract)

Computers communicate with each other using protocols like...:
    - **HTTP** > a standard that defines how websites data is communicated between 2 computers.
    - **TCP/IP** > a communication standard that defines how computers find and send data to each other.
